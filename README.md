# Sky View
Sky View is a weather forecasting platform for Australia that uses a neural network API to predict the weather based on data from the past seven days.

## Description 
Sky View is a weather forecast platform designed for Australia. The project uses an API connected to a pre-trained neural network to predict weather data. The model takes weather data from the past seven days and makes predictions for the next day. The platform integrates a weather forecast API to retrieve the necessary data for predictions. All complex logic is handled in the backend, so users do not need to worry about the technical details. To check the current or future weather, users simply select a location within Australia, adjust the toggle to choose between today's or tomorrow's weather, and click the "Check the Weather" button.
